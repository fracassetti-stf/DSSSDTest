# Depletion Voltage and Leakage Current 
For each detector, we varied the voltage from 60V up to 120/140V (depending on the detector) at step of 10V and register the corresponding value of Current and Peak Channel. 
This allow to monitor the current at first, and secondly to obtain the value of the depletion voltage, which is clearly visible looking at the shift of the channel of a certain peak.
The Excel file is divided in many sheets, one for each detector and one which has the plot of the results for all detectors.
