# Plot Strips
Simple macro to plot 16 strips on a single Canvas, this allow a very fast check on the strips spectra:
-  "015" or "1631" refers at the number of strip plotted: first half (from 0 to 15) or second half (from 16 to 31).  

Plot and Plot_Perm refers to the fact that the plot will follow the normal order (Plot), or a specific permuatation defined by the user (Plot_Perm). 
In our case, since the permutation needed was oldery performed during the conversion LMDtoROOT, then we used "Plot" to plot the strip in the correct order.
