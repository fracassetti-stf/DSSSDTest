# Characterization
For each detector, we varied the voltage from 60V up to 120/140V (depending on the detector) at step of 10V and register the corresponding value of Current and Peak Channel. The Excel file is divided in many sheets, one for each detector and one which has the plot of the results for all detectors. For some detector is possible to compare the plot of the Leakege current, and the value of the depletion voltage with the detector Datasheet (from Mircon, the company which produce these detectors).

## Leakage Current
We monitored the leakage current, for each detector a plot was produced.

## Depletion Voltage
In order to obtain the value of (full) depletion, we monitored the channel of one of the peak - we choose the <sup>239</sup>Pu for thise purpose, but any would work. The depletion voltage is clearly deducible by these plot: the peak channel will not increase after the condition of full-depletion is reached.
